\description{
This is a reformat and re-export of a function in the \code{MMWRweek} package.
It provides a snake case version of its counterpart and produces a vector
of \code{Date} objects that corresponds to the input MMWR year+week or year+week+day
vectors. This also adds some parameter checking and cleanup to avoid exceptions.
}

mwd <- mmwr_week_to_date(2016,10,3)
